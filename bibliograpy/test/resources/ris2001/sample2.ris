N2  - A method is disclosed for detecting the presence of HTLV III infected cells in a medium. The method comprises contacting the medium with monoclonal antibodies against an antigen produced as a result of the infection and detecting the binding of the antibodies to the antigen. The antigen may be a gene product of the HTLV III virus or may be bound to such gene product. On the other hand the antigen may not be a viral gene product but may be produced as a result of the infection and may further be bound to a lymphocyte. The medium may be a human body fluid or a culture medium. A particular embodiment of the present method involves a method for determining the presence of a AIDS virus in a person. The method comprises combining a sample of a body fluid from the person with a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen produced as a result of the infection and detecting the binding of the monoclonal antibody to the antigen. The presence of the binding indicates the presence of a AIDS virus infection. Also disclosed are novel monoclonal antibodies, noval compositions of matter, and novel diagnostic kits
