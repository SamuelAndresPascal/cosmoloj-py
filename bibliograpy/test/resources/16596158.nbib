TI  - Comparison of a camera - software system and typical farm management for 
      detecting oestrus in dairy cattle at pasture.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - AIM: To compare the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy of 
      detection of oestrus using a novel oestrus detection strip (ODS) and a 
      camera-software device (CSD) with typical farm management practices of visual 
      observation and use of tail paint in dairy cattle at pasture. METHODS: Dairy cows 
      (n = 480) in a seasonal-calving herd managed at pasture under typical commercial 
      conditions in New Zealand were stratified by age, body condition score and days 
      in milk, then randomly allocated to one of two groups prior to the planned start 
      of mating (PSM). Tail paint was applied to all cows and oestrus detected by 
      visual observation of oestrous behaviour and removal of paint, by farm staff. One 
      group (n = 240) was fitted with ODS and also monitored for signs of oestrus using 
      a CSD, while the Control group (n = 240) was monitored using tail paint and 
      visual observations only. Cows detected in oestrus were artificially inseminated 
      (AI), and pregnancy status determined using rectal palpation and ultrasonography, 
      51-52 days after the end of a 55-day A period. Results of pregnancy diagnosis 
      were used to confirm the occurrence of oestrus, and the sensitivity, specificity, 
      predictive value and accuracy of detection of oestrus compared between oestrus 
      detection methods. RESULTS: The sensitivity and accuracy of oestrus detection in 
      the Control group, using visual observation and tail paint, were low. Compared 
      with the Control group, detection of oestrus using the ODS and CSD resulted in 
      greater sensitivity (85% vs 78%; p = 0.006), specificity (99.6% vs 98.0%; p < 
      0.001), positive predictive value (PPV; 88% vs 51%; p < 0.001) and overall 
      accuracy (99.0% vs 98.0%; p < 0.001). Negative predictive value (NPV) did not 
      differ significantly between groups (99.4% vs 99.3%; p = 0.28). Pregnancy rate to 
      first service was higher in the CSD group than in the Control group (72% vs 39%; 
      p < 0.05). Use of the CSD significantly increased the cumulative proportion of 
      cows pregnant to AI over the breeding period (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: The ODS and CSD was satisfactory for detection of oestrus in seasonal 
      calving dairy herds grazing on pasture and could improve the sensitivity and 
      accuracy of detection of oestrus in herds where these are low.
