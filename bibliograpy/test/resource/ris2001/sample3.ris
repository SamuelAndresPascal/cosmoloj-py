N1  - OBJECTIVE: Data from the AIDS In Multi-Ethnic Neighborhoods survey are used to test Stages 1 & 3 of ARRM (a three stage process model of sexual risk behavior change; Catania, Kegeles, & Coates, 1990). Stage 1 analyses examine predictors of labeling one's sexual behavior in terms of HIV risk; Stage 3 concerns predictors of sexual behavior (e.g., condom use) (Stage 2 was not assessed in this first wave of the study but will be examined in wave 2). METHODS: Data were collected in a random household probability study of 1,781 white (41%), black (26%), and Hispanic (25%) (8% Other), unmarried respondents, aged 20-44, residing in selected "high risk" census tracts of San Francisco (Heterosexual = 83%, Homosexual = 13%, Bisexual = 4%). Labeling defined as making an accurate or inaccurate assessment of one's risk for HIV based on prior and current sexual practices. The behavioral outcome is frequency of condom use averaged across sexual partners for the past year. RESULTS: Multiple regression (Logistic & LSQ) analyses indicate that, 1) Accurate labeling of high risk behavior is related to high susceptibility beliefs (Imp. Chi Sq. =,92.46, p less than .0001), but unrelated to knowing someone with AIDS; gay relative to heterosexual men (p less than .03), and Hispanics compared to whites (p less than .01) were more likely to accurately label their behavior, 2) Greater condom use during vaginal or anal intercourse is significantly related to better sexual communication skills, higher perceived benefits and lower costs of condom use, but unrelated to religiosity, self-efficacy, and ethnicity (R's range from .50 - .66); these latter results are substantially the same for men and women, and heterosexuals and gay men. CONCLUSION: The findings 1) suggest the ARRM model is applicable to most social groups, 2) underscore the importance of interventions that enhance communication skills and teach methods of facilitating sexual enjoyment of condoms
